i have traffic_congestion data in:

"station_name,day,time,traffic_congestion"

Where station == station name
day = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 where 1 stands for Monday...and so on
time = hourly in range of 0-23.
traffic_congestion = in rannge 0-100 raw intergers showing percentage of traffic in station.

Is this data is good to show Last Mile Analytics Problem statment,  by running analysis on this data? 

-------------------------------------
"hourly_congestion = data.groupby('time')['traffic_congestion'].mean()"

There is change in code. The Time is in hour, in 0-23 format. please don't format without reason. i already preprocssed the data.

Im adding some lines of data for your reference:

```station_name,day,time,traffic_congestion

Ambar Tower,1,5,11
Ambar Tower,1,6,12
Ambar Tower,1,7,14
